# Show me the Meaning - an English dictionary extension

Not being a native English speaker, I always found it hard to follow things on the internet, especially checking out news or Wikipedia. Unfortunately I was not able to find a good dictionary extension that suited my needs, so I decided to make one. I did it using the help of Claude AI.

## Installation

The extension is planned to be released through the Firefox Extension marketplace.
